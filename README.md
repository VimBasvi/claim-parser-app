Journey

Started with Dropzone Component
Checked if it worked in page.tsx 
Parsed .txt file - had hard time with drag and drop - realized I had forgotten to include it in accepted files for the dropzone after an hr or so when upload wasn't working 


Installs:

npm install pdfjs-dist
npm install pdfjs-dist@3.11.174
